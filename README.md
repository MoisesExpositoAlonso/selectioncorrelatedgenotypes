# Selection on correlated genotypes: a simulation study with Arabidopsis thaliana

This repo contains a minimal example of simulations of fitness from a set of seleciton coefficients and a genome matrix, and a re-estimation of those realized selection coefficients using various GWA approaches. I used a subset of biallelic SNPs of a genome matrix of 515 Arabidopsis thaliana natural lines from [Exposito-Alonso et al 2018 bioRxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/321133). 

The results are compiled in the [gwasandsimulations.pdf](gwasandsimulations.pdf) document produced with R markdown.
